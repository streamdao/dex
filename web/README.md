Powered by Solana & Serum

```
Welcome to Non-custodial DEX Traded Funds (DTFs) developer documentation. The pages contain a description of the idea, resources, and guides for the StreamDEX.

DTFs Protocol is a Solana-and-Serum-based system that enables users to implement an asset management strategy in which others can invest. A strategy consists of a basket of SPL tokens encapsulated in a DTF program which is itself an SPL token. By supporting external integrations with exchanges, lending platforms, automated market makers, and asset protocols, DTFs enable any type of strategy including those employing. DTFs aim to be community-owned and will employ decentralized governance.
